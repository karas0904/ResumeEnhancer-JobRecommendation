   - Offers tailored suggestions to improve resumes based on job descriptions.  
   - Focuses on ATS (Applicant Tracking System) optimization to increase visibility to recruiters.

3. **Job Role Recommendations**:  
   - Leverages **NLTK** and machine learning algorithms to recommend relevant job roles based on the userâ€™s resume content.

4. **Resume Draft Generation**:  
   - Utilizes **Jinja2** to generate an initial resume draft customized to align with the provided job description.
